### **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**
1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   Open a terminal and run the following commands to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers huggingface-hub openai pandas json
   ```
   - `torch`: For PyTorch (required for running models).
   - `transformers`: For loading and using the DeepSeek model.
   - `huggingface-hub`: For downloading models from Hugging Face.
   - `openai`: For image generation (if using DALL-E or similar).
   - `pandas`: For handling CSV files.
   - `json`: For saving structured data.

2. **Load the DeepSeek Model Locally**:
   - If DeepSeek is available on Hugging Face, use the following code to load it:
     ```python
     from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

     # Load the model and tokenizer
     model_name = "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B"  # Replace with the actual model name
     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
     model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

     # Set the model to evaluation mode
     model.eval()
     ```
   - If DeepSeek is not available, replace it with a similar model (e.g., GPT-based models).

### **Step 2: Preprocess Lesson Content**
1. **Split `Lesson_Content` into Manageable Chunks**:
   - Use a sliding window approach to split the text into smaller chunks (e.g., 512 tokens per chunk).
   ```python
    def split_and_tag(text, lesson_name, grade, chunk_size=512):
        tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)
        
        chunks = [tokens[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(tokens), chunk_size)]
        chunk_texts = [tokenizer.decode(chunk) for chunk in chunks]

        # Tag each chunk with lesson name and grade
        tagged_chunks = [
            {"lesson": lesson_name, "grade": grade, "content": chunk}
            for chunk in chunk_texts
        ]

        return tagged_chunks

   # Example usage
    lesson_name = "Photosynthesis"
    grade = "Grade 8"

    with open("lesson_content.txt", "r") as file:
        lesson_content = file.read()

    chunks = split_and_tag(lesson_content, lesson_name, grade)

    # Print sample output
    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        print(f"Chunk {i+1} - Lesson: {chunk['lesson']}, Grade: {chunk['grade']}\nContent: {chunk['content'][:200]}...\n{'-'*40}")
    
    ```

2. **Save Chunks in a Structured Format**:
   - Save the chunks in a JSON file for easy access.
   ```python
   import json

   # Save chunks to a JSON file
   with open("lesson_chunks.json", "w") as file:
       json.dump(chunks, file)
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Generate Topics**
1. **Run the DeepSeek Model on Each Chunk to Extract Topics**:
   - Use the model to extract topics from each chunk.
   ```python
   def extract_topics(chunk):
       prompt = f"Extract the most relevant topics from the following lesson content that are likely to appear in exams:\n\n{chunk}\n\nReturn the topics as a list."
       inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
       outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200)
       topics = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
       return topics.split(", ")

   # Extract topics for all chunks
   all_topics = []
   for chunk in chunks:
       topics = extract_topics(chunk)
       all_topics.extend(topics)

   # Remove duplicates
   all_topics = list(set(all_topics))
   ```

2. **Save Topics in a CSV File**:
   - Use `pandas` to save the topics in a CSV file.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Save topics to a CSV file
   topics_df = pd.DataFrame(all_topics, columns=["Topic"])
   topics_df.to_csv("topics.csv", index=False)
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Generate Questions**
1. **For Each Topic, Generate Questions Using the DeepSeek Model**:
   - Use the model to generate questions for each topic.
   ```python
   def generate_questions(topic):
       prompt = f"Generate 5 exam-style questions for the topic '{topic}' suitable for [Class] [Subject] for [Board]. Ensure the questions are of medium difficulty and avoid duplication."
       inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
       outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=500)
       questions = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
       return questions.split("\n")

   # Generate questions for all topics
   question_bank = {}
   for topic in all_topics:
       questions = generate_questions(topic)
       question_bank[topic] = questions
   ```

2. **Save Questions in a Structured Format (e.g., JSON)**:
   - Save the question bank in a JSON file.
   ```python
   # Save questions to a JSON file
   with open("question_bank.json", "w") as file:
       json.dump(question_bank, file)
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Create Question Papers**
1. **Combine Questions from the Question Bank to Create Question Papers**:
   - Randomly select questions from the question bank to create a balanced question paper.
   ```python
   import random

   def create_question_paper(question_bank, num_questions=10):
       all_questions = [q for questions in question_bank.values() for q in questions]
       selected_questions = random.sample(all_questions, min(num_questions, len(all_questions)))
       return selected_questions

   # Create a question paper
   question_paper = create_question_paper(question_bank)
   ```

2. **Save Question Papers in a Structured Format**:
   - Save the question paper in a JSON file.
   ```python
   # Save question paper to a JSON file
   with open("question_paper.json", "w") as file:
       json.dump(question_paper, file)
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Validate Questions**
1. **Use a Secondary LLM to Validate Questions**:
   - Use another instance of the model to validate questions.
   ```python
   def validate_question(question):
       prompt = f"Review the following question for [Class] [Subject] and check for profanity, subject relevance, duplication, and bias:\n\n{question}\n\nReturn 'Valid' or 'Invalid' with reasons."
       inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
       outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200)
       validation_result = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
       return validation_result

   # Validate all questions in the question bank
   validated_questions = {}
   for topic, questions in question_bank.items():
       validated_questions[topic] = [validate_question(q) for q in questions]
   ```

2. **Save Validated Questions**:
   - Save the validated questions in a JSON file.
   ```python
   # Save validated questions to a JSON file
   with open("validated_questions.json", "w") as file:
       json.dump(validated_questions, file)
   ```
